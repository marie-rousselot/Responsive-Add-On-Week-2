            <h3>Lapland, a magical travel destination</h3>
            <p>
              Lapland is the northern-most region of Finland and an active
              outdoor destination that's known for its incredible, year-round
              light phenomena, vast arctic nature, and Santa Claus. The land of
              the indigenous Sámi people, known as Sámi homeland or Sápmi, also
              crosses the northern part of the region. Explore Finnish Lapland,
              Europe’s last great wilderness!
            </p>
            <p>
              Finnish Lapland is the best place in the world to see, enter and
              experience snow buildings such as igloos and ice saunas, as well
              as bigger buildings like snow hotels and the famous Lainio
              SnowVillage. And of course, you can't talk snow buildings without
              mentioning the biggest in the world: the Kemi SnowCastle.

                  with a modern twist. The Demeter certified artisan coffee

                  and the smoky heat of a campfire combine to make the best
                  specialty coffees north of the Arctic Circle. All freshly hand

                  They also offer a selection of freshly made sweet treats, both
                  vegan and non-vegan. Their delicacies are made with local,
                  Arctic ingredients such as lingonberries and chaga, and they
                  are all superbly yummy.

                  This atmospheric cafe offers tangible experiences. They bake
                  donuts every day and they make several pastries from
                  gluten-free dough. The specialty of the house is
                  Siikakurniekka: local whitefish fillet in a dough crust. A
                  fish lover's delicacy that is not fast food. There is usually
                  smoked reindeer soup on the kitchen table. They also prepare
                  vegan lentil soup - at least by order during quieter times.

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  They use a lot of organic and often also local ingredients.
                  For example, we buy flour from a Finnish mill. It is important
                  to them that we know where the raw materials of our products
                  come from! Our cafe features both art and story elements. You
                  might experience the presence of some elves there..
